# 📧 Email Spam Detection System

A complete **Machine Learning** and **Flask Web Application** that detects whether an email is **Spam or Ham (Not Spam)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was built as part of a **Data Science workshop**, where the goal was to apply end-to-end data analysis and machine learning on a chosen dataset.  
I selected an **Email Spam Detection** dataset and developed a complete ML pipeline — from data cleaning and feature extraction to web deployment.

---

## 🧠 What I Built

- Trained a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** for text classification.  
- Preprocessed textual data using **TF-IDF vectorization**.  
- Achieved high model accuracy and reliable classification.  
- Built a **Flask web application** for real-time spam prediction.  
- Designed a **modern and responsive UI** using HTML & CSS.
